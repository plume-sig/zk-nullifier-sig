# halo2-plume WASM Prover

This directory contains the code for the WASM prover for the halo2-plume circuit.

We use [halo2-wasm](https://github.com/axiom-crypto/halo2-browser/tree/main/halo2-wasm) to streamline the process of building WASM module for the halo2-plume circuit.

## Usage

You can use our pre-built WASM package - [plume-wasm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/plume-wasm) which makes it super easy to generate a proof on browser.

For an example implementation, please refer to `halo2/example-frontend`.
