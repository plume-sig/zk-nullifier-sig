/* Module consists of two tests; one for each type of signature. One of them also do printings of the values, which can be useful to you when
comparing different implementations (the values are also asserted by that one). 
Their setup is shared, `mod helpers` contains barely not refactored code, which is still instrumental to the tests.*/
